# track-babel-boilerplate-updates

#### Greenkeeper

Greenkeeper doesn't support nested package.json files. Therefore, it doesn't work for assets created by a Yeoman generator. This is a workaround repository that was generated using the [generator-babel-boilerplate](https://github.com/babel/generator-babel-boilerplate) project.

As packages are updated, I'll get PRs here, notifying me that I need to update the boilerplate.

#### Linting

This project also provides linting for the generated assets so that I can make sure I remain consistent.
